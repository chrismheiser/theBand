<p>Puppy Pendulum is a punk rock band from the cold, desolate Seattle, Washington. They started out as a group of high school friends that ran out of things to do in the summer of 2005. Since it rained every day that year, they often chose not to leave the house, and started learning how to play instruments in Brandon's garage. They played loudly. They played badly. The many months of practice finally started to form into sounds that resembled a punk rock style. <br>
	
The band released their first EP, "Throw us a Bone", and began playing small shows around the city. Puppy Pendulum couldn't gain popularity within their hometown, and by sumemr 2007 they began a tour on their own down the west coast. Their big break came in L.A. after a opening band dropped out and they were able to open for Rise Against.

    <h3>Cherie Parsons</h3>
    <p>My name is Cherie Parsons and I am the basist of Puppy Pendulum. It came naturally for us to start a band since Washington is an awful place to live. The weather is always bad, so staying inside and jamming all day was all there was to do. These people are some of the best friends I could ask for I and have enjoyed working with them.</p>
